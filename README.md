Vip Service prediction
==
1.`Description`
--
Commercial competition nowadays intensifies needs of user-side investigation. One of the solution to win out is, adapt advanced technology, as one implemented in this project –machine learning, together with additional skills, such as GBDT and Xgboost, to boost profit and even build brand image.

The primary objective is, implement effective ML algorithm to correctly predict potential user who will buy the service. Firstly, data will be inspected and cleaned to get satisfactory result. Meanwhile, visualization introduced to visually check prediction result. According to data analysis, multiple algorithms may be accessed and balanced to pick out best one.
2.`Project target` 
--
•	Practically implement ML algorithms to better understand machine learning
###
•	Better usage of powerful ML library, e.g.: Xgboost, scikit-learn
###
•	Learn how to adjust parameters
###
•	Attempt to visualize result
###
3.`Plan`
--
`To do list`:
###
•	Prepare necessary library
###
•	Talk in group and teach each other how to use
###
•	Settle down algorithm needed to implement
###
•	In-group meeting weekly
